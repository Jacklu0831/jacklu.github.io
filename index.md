## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/">NYU Courant</a> NYU Courant, advised by Prof. Mengye Ren in the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/">CILVR</a> lab. Prior to joining NYU, I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. Recently, my work focused on generative modeling, few-shot learning, and AI-assisted design.

I did a mixture of software engineering and research internships at  <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/">NVIDIA</a>,  <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/">NYU Courant</a> Waabi,  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cognos-analytics">IBM</a>, and  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-14/apple-aapl-buys-canadian-ai-startup-darwinai-as-part-of-race-to-add-features">DarwinAI</a>. I was fortunate to have worked with <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/">Prof. Raquel Urtasun</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/">Prof. Sanja Fidler</a>, and <a href="https://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~a28wong/">Prof. Alexander Wong</a>.
